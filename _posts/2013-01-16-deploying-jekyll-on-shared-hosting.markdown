title: Deploying Jekyll on Shared Hosting
---

Yesterday, I finally finished porting my website and blog to make use of the wonderful static site generator, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Actually jekyll-ing my site wasn't hard at all since it was already just a bunch of static files. Migrating my blog from WordPress (more on my motivation for doing this will be the topic of my next post) wasn't hard either since I only had two posts. What was a little befuddling/annoying/tedious to get working was deploying the site to my shared hosting server.
